      Choose a python module to use with marimo. This means all the packages in that
      module will be available in your notebook. marimo only works with recent versions
      of Python, so you will not see all `fhPython` modules here.

      **(Optional)** Path to a directory to start marimo in, or an existing notebook (`.py` file) to open.
      If not specified, the default is your `~/.marimo-notebooks` directory, which will be

      above will **not** be available in your notebook unless
      you loaded the module and then created the virtual environment
